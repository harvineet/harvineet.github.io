I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco in Prof. [Jean Feng's](https://www.jeanfeng.com/) group. I work on machine learning models for healthcare applications, in particular developing methods to explain and audit model performance across varying populations. Before this, I received a PhD in Data Science from New York University, advised by Prof. [Rumi Chunara](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/faculty/rumi-chunara). 

My research aims to understand the challenges in **responsible deployment and evaluation of machine learning systems**. With that goal, I develop methods in causal inference, algorithmic fairness, and interactive learning, motivated by applications in personalized and population health.

Previously, I was a Summer Fellow at Harvard Universityâ€™s Center for Research on Computation and Society, and an intern at Amazon Science and Microsoft Research. I worked as a research engineer at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com) before joining graduate school, where I built recommendation tools for data analysts. I completed my Integrated Masters from [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/) in Mathematics and Computing, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Prof. [Amitabha Bagchi](http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~bagchi/) and Prof. [Parag Singla](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/).
